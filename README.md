# PackIt!
üì¶ A handy app to help when you move :)

## Introduction
As a Waterloo Co-op student üè´, we typically move once four months. This creates a lot of trouble. 

Have you ever been standing in front of 10 boxes, but don't know which one has your CS135 course note in it? ***PackIt!*** is here to rescue!

Simply create boxes and add items into them. Later on, you can search by their name, or category in order to find where are them.

## Architecture
- Frontend: React + Semantic UI React
- Backend: NodeJS + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)

## Changelogs
- v1.1.1
    - Implemented registration functionality so that people can sign up for *Packit!* **(Note: Invitation code still required)**
- v1.1
    - User can now edit a single item by clicking on it
- v1.0.1
    - Fixed the issue that plus and minus buttons are reversed when creating a new item
- v1.0
